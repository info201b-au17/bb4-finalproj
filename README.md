# Project Description

Unfortunately, the world around us isn't entirely moral, so we have to be wary about where we park out bikes. No matter what strong locks we use, our bikes have a good chance of getting itself or its parts stolen. Our solution: A tool that allows **bike riders** to find the best parking space nearby for their bike.

For our project, we worked with two datasets provided by the Seattle Department of Transportation:

* A list of all [bike racks](https://data.seattle.gov/Transportation/City-of-Seattle-Bicycle-Racks/vncn-umqp) in or around Seattle
* A list of all reported [bike thefts](https://data.seattle.gov/widgets/8rw6-mmz7) in or around Seattle.

### What we did

![app landing page](/readmePictures/landingPage.png)

We created a map based on the last two years of bike theft data that shows which bike racks were Unsafe to Safe on a gradient.

![clicking on a point](/readmePictures/clickOnPoint.png)

A user can click on any point and look at data about that bike rack. They can see a quick statistic about its danger level, and they can click on a link to redirect them to a Google Maps view in a new tab.

This implementation is open-source and adaptable for places other than Seattle as long as they have some sort of dataset available for bike racks and bike thefts.

This tool is in a **functional beta state** that can be improved on in the future. The possibilities for new features are <strong style="color:#7033a1">boundless</strong>.

# Ethical Concerns

While this software aims to bring safety and security to the people, we must not ignore the problem we face with those who may misuse it. A potential danger is that certain individuals will see which areas are marked as "safe" and start looting bikes from that area. A major focus we have looking forward is finding a way around this problem that stems from bad human nature.
